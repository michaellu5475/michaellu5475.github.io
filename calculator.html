	<h3> Example </h3>
	<p id="12"> 12 &reg Why should the cooling towers of thermal power plants be curved rather than
		 straight up and down like chimneys? The reason for this is that the cooling tower is
		  large in volume and has a very high self-weight. If it is straight up and down, the
		   building materials at the bottom will bear such great pressure that they cannot 
		   bear it (as we know, the peak on the earth can only reach 30,000 meters, otherwise
		    the rocks at the bottom will melt). Now, the cooling tower edge into a hyperbolic
		     character, just can make every section of the same pressure, so that the cooling
		      tower can do a lot. Why it's a hyperbola is something that you can solve in 5 
		      minutes in calculus theory. </p>
	<p> &reg Windows comes with a calculator that allows you to perform simple calculations,
	 such as logarithms. Computers are computations that are based on addition, and when we 
	 talk about how many billion times we actually mean addition operations. So how do you 
	 convert a logarithm into an addition? In fact, using the series theory of calculus, you
	can convert a logarithm function into a series of multiplication and addition operations. </p>
